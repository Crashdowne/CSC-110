\nThe long running tv-seris ER created and written by Michael Crichton shows a number of societal vales and norms as well as their evolution over time.\n
\nIncluded in the values and norms displayed in the series are minority rights and family values.\n
\nThe series tended to include a number of actors from minority groups as main characters and spent much of its time on their back story and developing their character as the series progressed. One of the most significant accomplishments of the series was how well it captures the struggle of minorities in American culture as well as how that changed with time. 
As a medical show, it tended to stay current with medical issues as well as social issues. 
An example of this is how it introduced gay rights and the evolution of the issue within the context of the show its self. 
The issue is introduced slowly and carefully, as the 90s were still not an amazing time for gay rights, beginning with introducing the struggle with HIV/AIDS from a heterosexual point of view and having the character who would eventually be revealed as homosexual be compassionate towards the suffering co-worker. 
As the show progressed, it reflected a change in the culture which was becoming slowly more accepting of homosexuality through the character’s life in the workplace, relationships and struggles against bigotry. Many of the issues which faced gay rights activists and which are still faced today were embraced by the series and were resolved through the interaction of characters (“ER,” n.d.). This progression from repression to liberation over the course of a number of series tends to represents a change in Americal cultural values towards being more inclusive of minority groups (Sears, n.d). Evolving views on homosexuality through the story of characters is one of the many social values and norms addressed by the TV-series ER.
